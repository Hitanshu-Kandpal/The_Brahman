Put your images here (placeholders are referenced in code already).

Expected paths (you can change them in src/App.tsx):
- public/images/backgrounds/brahman.jpg
- public/images/backgrounds/shiva.jpg
- public/images/backgrounds/vishnu.jpg
- public/images/backgrounds/saraswati.jpg

- public/images/avatars/shiva.png
- public/images/avatars/vishnu.png
- public/images/avatars/saraswati.png

Tips:
- Backgrounds: 16:9 or wider, >= 1920x1080, darker top area helps header readability.
- Avatars: square images; we'll crop to a circle automatically.
